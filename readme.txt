Theme Options UI Builder for WordPress. A simple way to create & save Theme Options and Meta Boxes for free or premium themes.

== Description ==

OptionTree attempts to bridge the gap between WordPress developers, designers and end-users by creating fully responsive option panels and meta boxes with an ease unlike any other plugin. OptionTree has many advanced features with well placed hooks and filters to adjust every aspect of the user experience. 

Build your Theme Options panel locally with an easy to use drag & drop interface and then export a functioning `theme-options.php` file for production use that is i18n translation ready, with your custom text domain automatically inserted. 

And, in just a few simple lines of code, save settings to the database with a unique array ID so none of your Theme Options conflict with other themes that use OptionTree. 

Also, OptionTree now takes full advantage of the new color schemes introduced in WordPress 3.8, it looks and feels built-in.

#### Theme Integration

== Installation ==

**Plugin Mode**

1. Upload `option-tree` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
1. Click the `OptionTree->Documentation` link in the WordPress admin sidebar menu for further setup assistance.

**Theme Mode**

1. Download the latest version of OptionTree and unarchive the `.zip` directory.
1. Put the `option-tree` directory in the root of your theme. For example, the server path would be `/wp-content/themes/theme-name/option-tree/`.
1. You must deactivate and/or delete the plugin version of OptionTree.
1. Add the following code to the beginning of your `functions.php`.

`/**
 * Required: set 'ot_theme_mode' filter to true.
 */
add_filter( 'ot_theme_mode', '__return_true' );

/**
 * Required: include OptionTree.
 */
require( trailingslashit( get_template_directory() ) . 'option-tree/ot-loader.php' );`

For a list of all the OptionTree UI display filters refer to the `demo-functions.php` file found in the `/assets/theme-mode/` directory of this plugin. This file is the starting point for developing themes with Theme Mode.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there a demo theme I can install? =

There sure is, and I'm glad you asked. Download and activate the [OptionTree Theme](https://github.com/valendesigns/option-tree-theme) and get some experience setting up OptionTree on your own with detailed directions and tips.

= Why are my translation files not loading? =

It is important to note that when you use OptionTree as a plugin, you must store your language files in the `option-tree/languages` directory and use file names like `option-tree-es_ES.mo` & `option-tree-es_ES.po`. However, when using OptionTree in Theme Mode you must also create a `theme-mode` directory inside the `option-tree/languages` directory and store your files there with names like `es_ES.mo` & `es_ES.po`. This is due to the different naming conventions of the `load_plugin_textdomain()` and `load_theme_textdomain()` functions.

= I get errors or a blank screen when I activate the plugin. What's the deal? =

The most likely scenario is your theme already has OptionTree installed in Theme Mode. And since the plugin and theme version can't both be active at the same time without the sky falling on your head, your site has decided to throw in the towel. If that's not your issue, open up a support request and we'll figure it out together. UPDATE: As of OptionTree 2.4.0 the plugin version will not conflict with the Theme Mode version if they are both 2.4.0 or higher.

If you're not the developer of this theme, please ask them to test compatibility with version 2.1 before upgrading. If you are the developer, I urge you to do the same in a controlled environment.

There was an issue with the upload option type's JavaScript not allowing anything other than images to be sent to the editor. This urgent issue is now fixed and why this version is light on changes.

Removed get_option_tree() in the WordPress admin area due to theme conflicts.
